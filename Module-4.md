**1. Discuss about the language of propositions in probability assertions.**

**Answer:**  
The language of propositions in probability assertions refers to the formal way we express statements whose truth values affect probabilistic reasoning. In probability theory, propositions are logical statements that can be true or false, such as "It is raining" or "The patient has a cavity." Probability assertions assign a numerical likelihood to these propositions, enabling reasoning under uncertainty.

**2. Find a model for Probability of any Proposition.**

**Answer:**  
A probability model for any proposition is a mathematical framework that assigns a probability value (between 0 and 1) to each proposition. One common model is the probability space, comprising a sample space (Ω), a set of propositions (events), and a probability function P that satisfies Kolmogorov's axioms. For example, P(A) assigns a probability to proposition A.

**3. Discuss Basic Probability Notations and define the product rule in basic probability notation.**

**Answer:**  
Basic probability notations:
- P(A): Probability of event A.
- P(A ∩ B) or P(A, B): Probability that both A and B occur (joint probability).
- P(A | B): Probability of A given B occurs (conditional probability).
- P(A ∪ B): Probability of A or B occurring.

**Product Rule:**  
P(A, B) = P(A | B) × P(B)  
This expresses the joint probability as the product of the conditional probability and the probability of the given event.

**4. Distinguish conditional and unconditional probabilities with examples.**

**Answer:**  
- **Unconditional probability (marginal):** Probability of an event regardless of other events.  
  Example: P(Rain) = 0.3.
- **Conditional probability:** Probability of an event given that another event has occurred.  
  Example: P(Rain | Clouds) = 0.7 (probability of rain given that it’s cloudy).

**5. Define & prove the Bayes’ rule.**

**Answer:**  
Bayes’ Rule relates conditional probabilities:  
P(A | B) = [P(B | A) × P(A)] / P(B)

**Proof:**  
From the product rule:  
P(A, B) = P(A | B) × P(B) = P(B | A) × P(A)  
Rearranging:  
P(A | B) = [P(B | A) × P(A)] / P(B)

**6. Discuss the cause of uncertainty.**

**Answer:**  
Uncertainty arises from incomplete, imprecise, or noisy information about the environment or system. Causes include randomness in natural phenomena, lack of knowledge, measurement errors, and inherent unpredictability in complex systems.

**7. Given the Join the Probability Distribution Calculate**
- 1. P(Cavity)
- 2. P(Toothache)
- 3. P(Cavity ∨ Toothache)
- 4. P(Cavity | Toothache)

**Answer:**  
Assume a joint probability table:

|              | Toothache=T | Toothache=F | Total (Cavity) |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Cavity=T     | 0.08        | 0.02        | 0.10           |
| Cavity=F     | 0.01        | 0.89        | 0.90           |
| Total        | 0.09        | 0.91        | 1.00           |

1. **P(Cavity) = 0.10**  
2. **P(Toothache) = 0.09**  
3. **P(Cavity ∨ Toothache) = 0.10 + 0.09 - 0.08 = 0.11**  
4. **P(Cavity | Toothache) = P(Cavity=T, Toothache=T) / P(Toothache=T) = 0.08 / 0.09 ≈ 0.89**

**8. List and explain basic probability notations used in AI, such as joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities.**

**Answer:**  
- **Joint Probability (P(A, B)):** Probability that both A and B occur.
- **Marginal Probability (P(A)):** Probability of A, regardless of other variables.
- **Conditional Probability (P(A | B)):** Probability of A given that B has occurred.

---

**9. Discuss the problem of Uncertainty and how agents act under uncertainty with one example.**

**Answer:**  
Uncertainty in AI comes from partial observability, noisy sensors, or unknown environments. Agents handle uncertainty by reasoning with probabilities, maximizing expected utility, or using belief states.  
**Example:** A medical diagnosis agent uses patient symptoms and test results (which may be noisy or incomplete) to infer the most probable disease.

**10. Explain the concept of Full joint Probability distribution.**

**Answer:**  
A Full Joint Probability Distribution (FJPD) specifies the probability for every possible combination of variable values in a domain. It enables answering any probabilistic query about those variables.

---

**11. Define Bayes' rule and explain independence in conditional probability with one example**

**Answer:**  
**Bayes' Rule:**  
P(A | B) = [P(B | A) × P(A)] / P(B)

**Independence:**  
Two events A and B are independent if P(A | B) = P(A).  
**Example:** Tossing two fair coins: P(Heads on first | Heads on second) = P(Heads on first) = 0.5.

---

**12. Explain the concept of independence with suitable AI-based examples.**

**Answer:**  
Variables are independent if knowing the value of one does not affect the probability of the other.  
**AI Example:** In spam detection, the probability that an email contains "free" may be independent of whether it is sent on a Monday.

---

**13. Define Bayes’ Theorem. Derive the formula and explain each term using a real-world AI use case.**

**Answer:**  
**Bayes' Theorem:**  
P(H | E) = [P(E | H) × P(H)] / P(E)  
- H: Hypothesis (e.g., email is spam)
- E: Evidence (e.g., contains "win money")
- P(H): Prior probability (belief before seeing evidence)
- P(E | H): Likelihood (probability of evidence given hypothesis)
- P(E): Marginal probability of evidence

**Use case:** In spam filtering, Bayes’ theorem updates the probability that an email is spam given certain keywords.

**14. What is a full joint probability distribution (FJPD)? Represent the FJPD of two binary variables A and B and discuss how it can be used for inference.**

**Answer:**  
A FJPD lists the probability of every combination of values for variables A and B.

|         | B=true | B=false |
|---------|--------|---------|
| A=true  | 0.3    | 0.2     |
| A=false | 0.1    | 0.4     |

Total = 1.

**Usage:**  
- Marginalize: P(A=true) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5
- Conditional: P(A=true | B=true) = 0.3 / (0.3 + 0.1) = 0.75
